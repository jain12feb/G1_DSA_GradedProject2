### Question 1

Your friend is a chief architect, who is working on building a skyscraper, in Mumbai. The construction is in such a way that the floors will be constructed in other factories and they will be assembled. All the constructed sizes will be **distinct**.

The skyscraper needs to be constructed in N days with the following conditions :

1. Every day a floor is constructed in a separate factory of **distinct** size.
1. The floor with the larger size must be placed at the bottom of the building.
1. The floor with the smaller size must be placed at the top of the building.

Note: A floor cannot be assembled in the building until all floors larger in size are placed. As a friend he wants you to build a small program that will help him analyze the construction process, to avoid manual work and errors.
